# svg-icons

This repository packages many open-source icon packs as NPM modules under the [`@svg-icons` NPM organization](https://www.npmjs.com/org/svg-icons), distributing them as optimized SVGs with JSON metadata. The primary consumer of these packages is [styled-icons](https://github.com/jacobwgillespie/styled-icons).
